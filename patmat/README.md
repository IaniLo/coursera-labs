### Assignment: Huffman Coding

>Huffman coding is a compression technique used to reduce the number of bits needed to send or store a message.   
It's based on the idea that frequently-appearing letters should have shorter bit representations and less common letters should have longer representations. See  [Huffman Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)

### Implementation

Again, we are going to work with binary trees.
