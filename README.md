Inside some folders you'll find some more explanation about that specific assignment.
I also provided a cheatsheet for most important aspects of the course.

> This Specialization provides a hands-on introduction to functional programming using the widespread programming language, Scala. It begins from the basic building blocks of the functional paradigm, first showing how to use these blocks to solve small problems, before building up to combining these concepts to architect larger functional programs. You'll see how the functional paradigm facilitates parallel and distributed programming, and through a series of hands on examples and programming assignments, you'll learn how to analyze data sets small to large; from parallel programming on multicore architectures, to distributed programming on a cluster using Apache Spark. A final capstone project will allow you to apply the skills you learned by building a large data-intensive application using real-world data.

>The goal of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with the infrastructure and the tools required during this class. Even though the grade in this assignment will be excluded from your final grade for the course, it is important that you work through this assignment carefully.

# Week1
## Getting Started + Functions & Evaluation

Get up and running with **Scala** on your computer. 
In this section you'll learn the difference between two paradigms _functional programming paradigm_ and _functional imperative programming_. 
We are going to step through the basics of Scala; covering expressions, evaluation, conditionals, 
functions, and recursion.

## Assignment: Recursion 
* [Week 1 assignment](./recfun/README.md)

# Week2
## Higher Order Functions


This section, we'll learn about functions as **first-class values**, and **higher order functions**. 
We'll also learn about Scala's syntax and how it's formally defined. 
Finally, we'll learn about methods, classes, and data abstraction through the design of a 
data structure for rational numbers.
