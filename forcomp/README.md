# Week 6

### Assignment: Anagrams

An anagram of a word is a rearrangement of its letters such that a word with a different meaning is formed.
For example the word:
```code
anagram 
```
can be rearranged into:

```code
"nag a ram"
```
In a similar way, an anagram of a sentence is a rearrangement of all the characters in the sentence such that a new
sentence is formed. The new sentence consists of meaningful words, the number of which may or may not correspond to
the number of words in the original sentence.
For example:

```code
Da Vinci Code
```

is an anagram of the sentence:
```code
So dark the con of Man‚Äù
```
